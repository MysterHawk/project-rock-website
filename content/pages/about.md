Hi there!

I'm Antonio Gagliarducci, a web developer from Turin, Italy.

Currently I'm studying computer science at University and have a part-time job so I don't have a lot of time free, but my hobbies are:
- hacking stuff
- diy tube/solid state speaker/headphone amps
- building awesome projects! (you don't say :^)
- Reading about interesting stuff (my reading list is here currently: WIP)
- Listen to podcasts
- Working out (I'm using the Freeletics App)

If you have any question you contact me at [this address](mailto:gagliarducci.antonio@posteo.net), or on [Telegram](https://t.me/MysterHawk).
